1. Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the funstick device following the usual semantics (that is, with open).
Since the driver now reports events instead of polling for changes,
immediately after the open it will issue a series of synthetic events
 that you can read to check the initial state of the
funstick.

By default, the device is opened in blocking mode.

	int fd = open ("DEVICE", O_RDONLY);


2. Event Reading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the read is successful, it will return nothing


2.1 ioctl type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The possible values of ``type'' are

#define   LED_ON     _IO(MAGIC , 0)   /* led on  */
#define   LED_OFF    _IO(MAGIC , 1)   /* led off */
#define   BUZZER_ON  _IO(MAGIC , 2)   /* buzzer on */
#define   BUZZER_OFF _IO(MAGIC , 3)   /* buzzer off */
